## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "API Key is missing" Error
- Make sure you've added your Gemini API key to `.env`
- Restart the dev server after adding the key
- Check that the env variable is prefixed with `VITE_`

### Voice Recording Not Working
- Allow microphone permissions in your browser
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure you're using HTTPS in production

### TTS (Voice Responses) Not Working
- This is optional and will silently fail if there's an issue
- Check your API quota/limits in Google AI Studio
- Text responses will still work normally

### Build Errors
```bash
# Clear node modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

## 🎨 Customization

### Change Voice
Edit `src/services/gemini.ts` line ~168:
```typescript
voiceName: 'Kore'  // Options: Kore, Puck, Charon, Aoede
```

### Adjust Medical Knowledge
Add more conditions to `src/data/medicalKnowledge.ts`:
```typescript
"condition_name": {
  definition: "...",
  causes: ["..."],
  symptoms: ["..."],
  precautions: ["..."]
}
```

### Modify Emergency Keywords
Edit `src/data/medicalKnowledge.ts` EMERGENCY_KEYWORDS array

## 🔐 Security Notes

- ✅ API key is client-side (free tier is okay)
- ✅ For production, use server-side API calls
- ✅ Add `.env` to `.gitignore`
- ✅ Never expose your API key publicly

## 📊 API Usage

Gemini API free tier includes:
- 15 requests per minute
- 1500 requests per day
- 1 million tokens per day

Perfect for testing and small applications!
